That was the young heartbreaker's vision
   While riding stagecoach in the mud,
   By Jove's excellent decision
   Being heir to all ancestral blood.
   Supporters of my previous glory
   With hero of this novel story
   Not waiting for another chance
   Let me acquaint you at once.
   Onegin was my close buddy,
   Who lived on Northern river shore
   Where also you may have been born
   Or showed brilliance in study.
   I thither had my better days,
   But in the North I have no grace.
